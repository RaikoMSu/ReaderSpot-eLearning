# Fix Implementation Instructions

This document contains instructions to fix several issues in the ReaderSpot application.

## 1. Database Column Error

The error `column user_preferences.has_completed_onboarding does not exist` is occurring because the application is looking for this column but it doesn't exist in your database.

**Solution:**
1. Run the SQL script we created to add the necessary columns to both tables:
   - Navigate to the Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Open and run the file `add_onboarding_columns.sql` from the `supabase` directory
   - This will add the missing columns and ensure data consistency

## 2. Multiple GoTrueClient Instances

The warning about multiple GoTrueClient instances is fixed by implementing a singleton pattern for the Supabase client. We've updated the `supabase.ts` file to use this pattern.

## 3. Image Priority Warning

The warning about adding priority to LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) images is fixed by adding the `priority` attribute to the flag images in the `LanguageCard` component.

## 4. Missing Placeholder Images

We've added the following placeholder images:
- `/public/placeholder.svg` - General placeholder for images
- `/public/placeholders/pdf-cover.svg` - Placeholder for PDF book covers
- `/public/placeholders/epub-cover.svg` - Placeholder for EPUB book covers

## 5. AuthContext Fix

We've updated the `AuthContext.tsx` file to:
- Check for onboarding status in `user_profiles` table (matching the onboarding page)
- Add a `preventRedirect` mechanism to stop unnecessary redirects on refresh
- Include logic to check for a `noRedirect` parameter or localStorage flag

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Restart your development server
3. Test the application by:
   - Logging in to ensure no redirect loops occur
   - Uploading a book and checking the progress indicator works
   - Refreshing the page to verify you stay on the current page
   - Checking the browser console for any remaining errors

## Additional Improvements

1. Improved upload progress animation for better user feedback
2. Added storage for user preferences across app restarts
3. Created consistent placeholder images for all file types
